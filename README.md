There is an XPS section which is focused on fitting small sections of XPS spectra with a simple to use shirley background correction and then using flexible fitting methods using pseduo-vogit distribution profiles. 

There is a FTIR section which can plot many spectra quickly as "subtraction" spectra or "difference" spectra. This allows for quick analysis of the evolution of FTIR spectra as a function of many cycles of ALD/ALE. There is a comprehensive integration method which will allow to integrate and plot regions of FTIR spectra. As well there is comprehensive peak fitting funtionallity for understanding peak overlap in FTIR. 

There is a XRD section which can background correct using an asymetric least squared background corrections along with rough peak fitting and some simple calculations for using sheerers equation in order to find grain size.

There is a section for spectroscopic ellipsometry which is a simple plotting system for thickness changes that are given from SE dynamic modeling, along with simple linear regression which can help get rough etching rates quickly.
